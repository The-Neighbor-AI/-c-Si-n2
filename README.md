The physical substrate employs a 3D Octet-Truss structure to balance mechanical rigidity and thermal dissipation.

- **Material**: 9N-Pure Silicon (Single Crystal)
- **10% Void (Critical Buffer)**: 10% of the total volume is maintained as a vacuum/void.
    - **Physical function**: Storage of torsional stress energy during thermal expansion.
    - **Logical function**: De-homogenization buffer to prevent information decay (decoherence).
- **Negative Thermal Expansion (NTE) Mechanism**:
    - Asymmetric coating of $SiO_2$ (2-5nm thickness) on silicon arms.
    - Under operational heat ($60^\circ\text{C}$ to $80^\circ\text{C}$), the differential in thermal expansion coefficients induces a "twisting" motion, reflecting heat noise as directional phonon transport.
